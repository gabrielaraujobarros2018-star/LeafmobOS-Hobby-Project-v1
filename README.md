# LeafmobOS

1. This OS was designed to be a real bootable OS, but it turned out to be a Hobby OS that has almost no code and serves as a starting point for new OSes

2. Now, i put the License as MIT because this OS is now for newbies and newbies don't want burnout.

3. the official README.md is now deleted, turning this readme as the official one.

4. Leafmob now will evolve sequentially (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, all way up to 5.1) to maintain simplicity

5. now the version will start from 1.0 instead of 0.5 to maintain simplicity

6. Don't expect active development, i'll have breaks to avoid burnout. and Don't expect this to be a real OS because this is now a hobby OS with little code.

7. You're allowed to copy this directory tree, but only copy the assets if it'll fit in your project and not cause inequalities.

8. Credit Aquamint44 after copying the directory tree.

9. i Almost lost this project, but it was saved on my /downloads folder, so i took advantage of the situation to declare this a Hobby OS.
